## WebRTC PoC
This is a small project I created to learn WebRTC. Perhaps it can also serve as a learning tool or reference project if I implement someting real.

## Setup
Check the client folder for setup instructions for the client.

## ToDo
I try to make progress on Saturdays
- [x] Dummy client side with working video feeds
- [ ] Replace pub-sub with actual signaling service
- [ ] Replace client-side with actual video chat
