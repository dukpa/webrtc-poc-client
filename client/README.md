## WebRTC PoC

This is the client side of a small project I created to learn WebRTC. Perhaps it can also serve as a learning tool or reference project if I implement someting real.

## Setup
Should be a straightforward process as this is created from a create-react-app template:
```
git clone https://github.com/dukpa/webrtc-poc-client
npm install
npm start
```

## ToDo
I try to make progress on Saturdays
- [x] Dummy client side with working video feeds
- [ ] Replace pub-sub with actual signaling service
- [ ] Replace client-side with actual video chat
